__ Before you run: __
    1. Be sure to install all requirements located in the file "requirements.txt"
    2. Run the program out of the "main.py" file

*** Keep in mind that the file paths are based off of you current working directory ***

This program takes in a user query and then matches elements of that query to known facts about the representative in
question. This then returns these facts and asks again what the user want to know. This is repeated until the quit
case is meet, that being "q","quit", or "exit". A history of the information received in this session as well as time
elapsed are located in the "stats.txt" file.

**Accepted keywords to user are as follows:**
    personal_info_list = ["info", "about", "from"]
    phone_info_list = ["phone", "number", "contact"]
    name_list = ["name", "full name", "last name", "who"]
    committee_list = ["committee"]
    service_list = ["service", "record", "long", "served"]
    address_list = ["live", "where", "address"]
    quit_cases = ["q", "quit", "exit", "bye", "goodbye"]
    all_list = ["everything", "all"]
